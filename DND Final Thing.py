# This is the final project for phase 1.
# Emulate a DnD, one-on-one battle!
# Goal 1: Must be interactive.
# Goal 2: Use a function in a module we have not yet explored.

# Rules:
# Must use at least one class
# Must use at least one dictionary
# Must use math
# Import and use at least one module
# Must use loops and if/else

# Importing modules
import random
import time
